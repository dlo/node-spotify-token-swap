# Node Spotify Token Swap Service
Spotify Token Swap service for Node.js environments. Used to swap out and refresh tokens for client applications from Spotify SDKs.

![Travis Build](https://travis-ci.org/rorygilchrist/node-spotify-token-swap.svg?branch=master)

## Setting up
To begin using this service, simply clone this repository (`git clone git@github.com:rorygilchrist/node-spotify-token-swap.git`), set your environment variables and run `node app.js`. The required environment variables are as follows:
- `CLIENT_ID` - Your client's ID. This can be found on your app page on [Spotify Developer Portal](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications).
- `CLIENT_SECRET` - Your client's secret key. This can be found on your app page on [Spotify Developer Portal](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications).
- `CALLBACK_URL` - Your application's callback url. You should have set this up when you created your app.
- `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` - Secret key used to encrypt and decrypt your refresh tokens. If this is not set, a key will be automatically generated and will change on application restart causing all of your currently logged in users to be logged out on refresh.
- `ACCESS_LOG` - Optional. Any setting other than 'off' is ignored. Used to turn off per-request output logging.

Environment variables can be setup in Linux environments with the command:
` export FOO=bar`, where FOO is the variable name and bar is the value. An example would be `export CLIENT_ID=yourclientid`. This can also be done on Windows, but you're better off asking Google than me (: 

### Deploying to Heroku
This application is built for deployment in a Heroku environment (however it can be deployed anywhere else that Node.js can run). To follow this tutorial, you'll need the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

#### Deploying your code
1. In your command line, navigate to the cloned repository run `heroku login` and enter your credentials.
2. Create a new application container for your token swap service `heroku create`
3. Set your environment variables by running `heroku config:set KEY=VALUE`, where KEY is a variable name, such as `CLIENT_ID` and VALUE is the value of the variable.
4. Run the command `git push heroku master` to deploy your application.
5. Finally, to fire up your server, run `heroku ps:scale web=1`. This will launch a free instance of your application which will shutdown after 10 minutes of inactivity and will be awoken when it's needed.

#### Keeping your app alive

While Heroku is a great, easy to use, platform the fact it shuts your free app down after 10 minutes sucks. There is a way around this and it's super easy.

1. Navigate to the application folder and run the command `heroku addons:add newrelic:wayne`, this will create a New Relic account for you and add your app to it. 
2. Restart your server using the command `heroku ps:restart web`.
3. That's it, the rest has already been done for you. To monitor uptime, dive into the New Relic dashboard & configure pings.

### Using New Relic on a non-Heroku deploy
If you don't want to use Heroku to deploy your application, that's fine. You can still use New Relic to monitor uptime and performance. Simply [sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup), get your licence key and add it as an environment variable called `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`. Once you've done this, restart your server and your data should start appearing in your New Relic dashboard.

## Using token swap service
The service has only two endpoints; one for swapping an auth code and the other for refreshing an access token.

#### /swap
Takes POSTed `www-form-urlencoded` data, with the parameter `code` which should be the authentication code provided by Spotify post-login. The swap service returns a JSON object similar to that which Spotify would return itself, the only difference being the `refresh_token` is encrypted before being sent.

#### /refresh
Takes POSTed `www-form-urlencoded` data, with the parameter `refresh_token` which should be the encrypted refresh token as provided by the `/swap` endpoint. The refresh token is then decrypted and used to get a new access token. The service *may* return a new encrypted refresh token, so your application should be set up to handle and store this.

*Note:* if your `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` has changed between /swap and /refresh requests, the encrypted refresh_token will be invalid for use within the swap service. The encrypted token however will stay active with Spotify until it either expires. It's recommended that when changing your `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`, you also regenerate your `CLIENT_SECRET` within the Spotify Developer Portal.
